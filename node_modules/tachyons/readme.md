# TACHYONS

Functional css for humans.

Quickly build and design new UI without writing css.

## Principles

* Everything should be 100% responsive
* Everything should be readable on any device
* Everything should be as performant as possible
* Designing in the browser should be easy
* It should be easy to change any interface or part of an interface without breaking any existing interfaces
* Doing one thing extremely well promotes reusability and reduces repetition
* css is global. HTML is not. Send the smallest amount of code to the user as possible.

## Features

* Mobile-first css
* Single-purpose class structure
* Optimized for maximum gzip compression
* ~13kB when minified and gzipped
* Usable across projects
* Infinitely nestable responsive grid system
* Built with Postcss

## Getting started

Docs can be found at http://tachyons.io/docs
The modules are generally pretty small and thus easy to read and grock if you're familiar with css at all.

### Use the CDN

The quickest and easiest way to start using tachyons is to include a reference
to the minified file in the head of your html file.

Currently the latest version is 4.5.2
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.5.2/css/tachyons.min.css">
```

You can always grab the latest version with
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons/css/tachyons.min.css">
```

### Local Setup

Clone the repo from github and install dependencies through npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons.git
cd tachyons
npm install
```

#### Build

##### First time

Tachyons is available as a series of small self contained css modules. They aren't dependent on eachother but
are designed to play well together. But tachyons is also just css. And you should feel free to edit css
that is in your project. The first time you build tachyons all of the css gets installed via npm, but the modules
then get copied over to your local src directory and then the [`tachyons-cli`](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-cli)
uses a series of postcss plugins to compile the source down to vanilla css.

##### Updating

If you want to update a tachyons partial, install the desired module version via npm and run the build command again. Note
this will copy over all source files, so if you've modified src/ your changes might will be overwritten but you can use version control (like git!) to undo these changes.

```npm run build```

#### Dev

If you want to just use src as a jumping off point and edit all the code yourself, you can compile all of your wonderful changes by running

```npm start```

This will output both minified and unminified versions of the css to the css directory.

If you want to recompile everything from src everytime you save a change - you can run the following command, which will compile and minify the css

```npm run build:watch```

If you want to check that a class hasn't been redefined or 'mutated' there is a linter to check that all of the classes have only been defined once. This can be useful if you are using another library or have written some of your own css and want to make sure there are no naming collisions. To do this run the command

```npm run mutations```

## Contributing

If you want to make a PR to change part of the css source for tachyons, make sure you make the PR on the corresponding module
that can be found in the [tachyons org](http://github.com/tachyons-css/). Those modules get copied into the main repo so
any changes you make to the css in this repo would get overridden.

Also please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) for contributors.
